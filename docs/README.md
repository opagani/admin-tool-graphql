### Install Git, Node, and npm

If you have any problems with these steps, make sure you see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

**Need to install Git?** - http://git-scm.com/downloads

**Need to install Node?** We recommend using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) instead of installing from source. Installing from source works, but it's difficult to maintain your Node version later on (which is why `nvm` exists)

**Windows Users!** Please read the [Windows Users](#windows-users) section below for installing Node and WSL.

If you need to verify that you have NVM installed: `nvm --version`. Then install Node:

```sh
# Installs LTS version 14 of Node
# See this page for more install options: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage
$ nvm install v14
```

To change to v14 of node:

```sh
$ nvm use v14
```

Verify you have Git, Node, and npm installed. Installing Node will install npm.

```sh
$ git --version
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

You need the version 14 of Node at this time.

### Install and Run the Code

Then **clone**, **install**, and **run** the app:

```sh
# Clone the repo to your local machine (This just clones, it does not "install")
$ git clone https://bitbucket.hotterpads.com/scm/rp/rentals-js.git

# Whichever directory you run the above command from, that directory should
# now have a folder called `rentals-js`.

# Change directory to the `rentals-js` folder:
$ cd rentals-js

# Install yarn globally
$ npm install -g yarn

# Install and run. Make sure you do these two commands from within the `react-workshop` folder:
$ yarn

# Run the rent-guarantee-graphql app
$ rjs ws run g-graphql dev

# If you have issues, read below.
```

Everything is working if the code compiles you could see the following log message in the terminal window:  
`âœ… server HMR enabled { port: '4000', msg: 'server started' } No issues found. `

If something goes wrong, you may need to see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below. We even have a special section for [Windows Users](#windows-users)

#### Prettier Plugin

(not required, but nice)

You might notice as the instructors save their code that a tool called "Prettier" is automatically formatting things. If you use VSCode, here is the [prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) you need to install. Clicking the install button on the website will open VSCode and install it as a plugin. However you install it, many code editors will just pick up on the settings we've setup for prettier in our `package.json` file.

## Updating the Code

If you've already cloned the repo but you need to get updated code, then follow these steps:

- First, `cd` into the root directory of the repo
- Then do an `ls` command to ensure you see a `package.json` file listed. If you don't you're not in the root folder of the repo
- Clear out any dirty files in your Git working tree (`git stash` is a safe way to do it, `git reset ---hard` is how to live dangerously)
- Then run these steps to get the updates:

```sh
  git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main
  yarn
```

Then you should be able to do your `npm start` again.

## Running GraphQL Playground

To run GraphQL playground in your browser (development), go to:

```sh
  http://localhost:4000/rent-guarantee-graphql/graphql
```

## Deployment to production

```sh
  https://stella.hotpads.com/stella/app/rent-guarantee-graphql/rent-guarantee-graphql_publish
```

## Stand alone restarting app in staging - comet1

```sh
  https://build.hotterpads.com/view/staging/job/build_comet1_staging_node_app/build?delay=0sec
```

```sh
  app:  rent-guarantee-graphql
```

## Troubleshooting

A few common problems:

- **You're having problems cloning the repository.** Some corporate networks block port 22, which Git uses to communicate with GitHub over SSH. Instead of using SSH, clone the repo over HTTPS. Use the following command to tell Git to always use `https` instead of `git`:

```sh
$ git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://

# This adds the following to your `~/.gitconfig`:
[url "https://"]
  insteadOf = git://
```

- **You're having trouble installing Node.** We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). nvm makes it really easy to use multiple versions of Node on the same machine painlessly. After you install nvm, install the latest stable version of Node with the following command:

```sh
$ nvm use default stable
```

- **You can't start the app with `$ rjs ws run g-graphql dev`.** If the app hangs and does not start, it is possible that the PORT_DEV env variable in the code is missing. Run CTRL + C to kill the command. If you see the following log message at the terminal: `missing PORT_DEV env variable`. The port 3001 which it is used by PORT_DEV by the code may be in use. This is the case when you run the rent-guarantee-admin-web, which uses port 3001, before the reant-guarantee=graphql app. Try `lsof -i tcp:3001` (Mac/Linux). If you see a process running kill the process by running the command `kill pidnumber`. Then run the graphql server: `rjs ws run g-graphql dev`.

### Windows Users

Don't use spaces in your repo folder name, we've had some issues with Windows users regarding this if you're not using WSL. **However, you should use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instead of GitBash or PowerShell**. Just about all of our Windows issues come from non WSL users. Even Microsoft documentation recommends it for running Node projects:

- WSL 2 Installation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
- Node on Windows: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2

From their docs:

> "There are multiple ways to install Node.js. We recommend using a version manager as versions change very quickly. You will likely need to switch between multiple versions based on the needs of different projects you're working on"

They will recommend you install `nvm` (Node Version Manager). We agree!

<hr />

Not using WSL can have a few problems that might arise in a Windows Environment:

- Repos with spaces can fail to build.
- Permissions issues when attempting to clone the repo. If you are using WSL but usually use another shell, you may want to copy your SSH keys where WSL can access them. [This article explains why this is necessary and how to do it.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/sharing-ssh-keys-between-windows-and-wsl-2/)
- If you do `npm run app` or `npm start` and you get weird errors instead of our menu system, we don't know what that is yet but the only reporters have been using GitBash instead of PowerShell.

<hr />

If you're a Windows user who already does active JS/Node development then you should be good-to-go. Otherwise this section might be able to help.

Consider using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (A lightweight version of Visual Studio) for our workshops as it is probably more appropriately suited for modern JavaScript development than Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc. It has a terminal built-in which uses PowerShell by default, but you can configure it to use WSL which is what we recommend.

If you want, you can go into Windows' settings to turn on file extensions. In JavaScript projects, it's common to have a filename like `.gitignore` which would be difficult to see without extensions turned on. It's not required though.

If these instructions for Windows users can be improved, please let us know or make a PR!
